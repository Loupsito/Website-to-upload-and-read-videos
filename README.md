# Website-to-upload-and-read-videos
This website give the possibility to upload videos in server and to read them.

/!\ Warning /!\
In XAMPP, the default size authorized to upload is 8 mo.
So if you want to upload any file superior at 8 mo (200 in my case), you need to change the php.ini
In this file, you will find several parameters to change. 
Ex : parameters with "=128M" ,"=6M", etc.

Don't forget also the time to upload, if the time to upload is big, this parameter must be change
